excerpt: I checked the creation date of a file from the recording of my new album today - November 2011. Myself and my friend Will spent a few days recording the basic acoustic guitar tracks back then at a friend's house whilst they were away on holiday. This worked well for them as they needed someone to look after both the house and their cat whilst they were away.

I checked the creation date of a file from the recording of my new album today - November 2011. Myself and my friend Will spent a few days recording the basic acoustic guitar tracks back then at a friend's house whilst they were away on holiday. This worked well for them as they needed someone to look after both the house and their cat whilst they were away. We created a recording room out of my friends spare room, hanging blankets and dressing gowns on the wall to deaden the sound and a control room in the downstairs living room. We also hired some really microphones in order to get the best sound possible. I felt happy and carefree as I was finally getting a chance to record these songs that I'd had in my head for so long. So much has changed since then, the room we recorded in being one of them as it's now the bedroom for my friend's 3 year old son. 

The plan was to release an album a few months later,  allowing myself say 6 months or so to get it all ready. It's a lot of work to do when you're doing most of it yourself but I was looking forward to spending some time on a new creative project. In addition to the new recordings I was going to add a few songs from my previous EP, "Where Once Were Roads" to the album.

I remember when the police came to my door in June 2012 to let me know my parents had been involved in a car accident. I had recorded most of the extra parts to the songs but still had some mixing to do and was in the middle of making the scenes for the Scrollatron in my "Bubble Clouds" video. The police checked who I was and then assured me that my parents were ok but both were confused and my Dad had fractured his neck. It's funny how things that seemed so important one minute can suddenly feel less so when you have family to care for.  The album was immediately put on the backburner as the next week or so saw me driving to Southampton everyday to the hospital where my Dad was staying. 

Many more things happened over the next couple of years, much of it spent helping my brothers with my parent's recovery.  I had one of the new songs, "Postcard", ready around the beginning of 2013 so released it as a single to promote the album I still hoped to finish later that year. It got some airplay on Tom Robinson's show on BBC 6music and had some really nice comments on Soundcloud. Towards the end of 2013 I knew I still needed more time to finish the album properly so I released the four songs I did have ready as the "3 Penny Postcard" EP.  I  did a little tour to promote the EP but didn't have much time or money to do much more promotion.

In the summer of 2015 I released a new EP containing four remixes of my song "Forgotten". These were more electronic in style and again found airplay on Tom Robinson's BBC 6music show whilst I was up in Edinburgh playing at the Fringe Festival.

It's now the beginning of 2016 and I'm happy to say the mixing, mastering and artwork for the album is now finished. The album features the songs I planned to have on it all those years ago including four new songs and another new remix of my song Forgotten. All of the older recordings have been remastered again alongside the unreleased recordings. The CDs are being replicated and promo copies are on their way to the press and radio and I'm now in the process of writing a book of short stories to go with the album as a limited edition gift.  

Although the album is the resolution of something I planned all those years ago the meaning of some of the songs has evolved into something new. "Choccy Rolls" was once just about a lady with dementia  that my Mum looked after when she was a home help. Mum used to do her shopping for her among other things and bought her Cadbury's mini rolls and borrowed large print books for her from the library. The song now has an extra level of poinancy now I've witnessed first hand how dementia can affect a loved one, slowly taking their words away from them. 

I performed "Dancers in a Painting" at both of my parents funerals. The lyrics about something so beautiful yet transient  seemed fitting to me and I would have found it too upsetting to have read something; singing feels a much more natural way to express myself. 

On a more happier note one of my remixes of "Forgotten (Jigsaw Goldrush mix)" was used as one of the first dances at my wedding and "Candid Grandma" and "True Nature of Cats" both give me fond memories of a gig venue in West London where I performed them both for the first time.

Many sad and wonderful things have happened during these 4 years, the saddest being my parents are no longer here to share this moment. So this album is dedicated to their memory, and to the new life my Wife and our expecting later this Spring.
