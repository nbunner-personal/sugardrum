<p>Sugardrum is a solo project of singer and multi-instrumentalist <a title="web design and music by Nigel Bunner" href="http://www.nigelbunner.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nigel Bunner</a>, who writes and performs acoustic storytelling songs lying on the boundary between folk and indie. He has so far self-released 4 EPs, the two most recent receiving airplay on both <strong>BBC 6music</strong> and <strong>BBC South</strong>.</p>
<p>Nigel’s songs feature a dazzling, unique fingerpicking acoustic guitar style and beautiful vocal harmonies, being likened to Surfjan Stevens and Nick Drake with <em>"thought provoking lyrics matched with a gift for melody"</em>.</p>
<p>The current EP of original songs "3 Penny Postcard" is the follow up to “Where Once Were Roads” and develops Nigel’s acoustic sound further enriched by cello, percussion and electronica.</p>
<p>His live set comprises of his own songs along with a couple of covers. He closed his final set at the 2014 <strong>Edinburgh Festival</strong> with an unplugged personal interpretation of “There is a light” by The Smiths, standing in front of the stage to a packed and enthralled audience at Tron Kirk Church on the Royal Mile.</p>
<p>Notable recent festival and tour performances include several performances at the 2015 &amp; 2014 Edinburgh Fringe Festivals, 2014 <strong>Glastonbury festival</strong> and a week long tour in Winter 2013 to promote the release of the “3 Penny Postcard” EP.</p>
<p>Nigel has also played support slots for Martha Tilston, Union Sound Set, Rachel Sermanni &amp; Carrie Tree and has helped organise numerous collaborative fundraising events together with the rest of the <a title="Wupadupa music" href="http://www.wupadupa.com/" target="_new">Wupadupa collective</a>.</p>
<p>Just as happy playing unplugged guerilla gigs as he is on the stage, some random places where Nigel has performed include: Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, England, a wooded glade lit up by fairy lights, a train travelling through India and on the top deck of a double decker bus that was doubling up as a cafe at the time, with the customers jamming along with the songs.</p>
