<p>Sugardrum is a solo project of singer and multi-instrumentalist Nigel Bunner, who writes and performs acoustic storytelling songs lying on the boundary between folk and indie. He has so far self-released 5 EPs and 1 album,  receiving airplay on both <strong>BBC 6music</strong> and <strong>BBC South</strong>.</p>

<p>Sugardrum’s songs feature a dazzling, unique fingerpicking acoustic guitar style and beautiful vocal harmonies, being likened to Surfjan Stevens and Nick Drake with <em>&#8220;thought provoking lyrics matched with a gift for melody&#8221;</em>.</p>

<p>Last year Sugardrum released a remix EP &#8220;Forgotten Remixed&#8221; featuring electronic and dance based remixes of his song Forgotten. The debut album of original songs, &#8220;Postcards&#8221; is the follow up to this and his previous EPs &#8220;3 Penny Postcard&#8221; and &#8220;Where Once Were Roads&#8221;. The new album develops Sugardrum’s acoustic sound further, enriched by cello, percussion and electronica.</p>

<p>Sugardrum's live set comprises of his own songs along with a couple of covers. He closed his final set at the 2014 <strong>Edinburgh Festival</strong> with an unplugged personal interpretation of “There is a light” by The Smiths, standing in front of the stage to a packed and enthralled audience at Tron Kirk Church on the Royal Mile.</p><p>Notable recent festival and tour performances include several performances at the 2015 &amp; 2014 Edinburgh Fringe Festivals, 2014 <strong>Glastonbury festival</strong> and a week long tour in Winter 2013 to promote the release of the “3 Penny Postcard” EP.</p>

<p>Sugardrum has also played support slots for Martha Tilston, Union Sound Set, Rachel Sermanni &amp; Carrie Tree and has helped organise numerous collaborative fundraising events together with the rest of the <a

<p>Just as happy playing unplugged guerilla gigs as he is on the stage, some random places where Sugardrum has performed include: Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, England, a wooded glade lit up by fairy lights, a train travelling through India and on the top deck of a double decker bus that was doubling up as a cafe at the time, with the customers jamming along with the songs.</p>
