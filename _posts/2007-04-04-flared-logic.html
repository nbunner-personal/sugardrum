<p>Went to one of the Teenage Cancer trust gigs at the Albert Hall last  week. It was the one with Noel Fielding from the mighty Boosh and  Russell Brand hosting an evening of comedians doing their thang. People  say that musicians are brave getting up on stage performing in front of  an audience but I reckon Comedians are far braver.</p>

<p>Russell Brand  did a funny skit about the options available to drug addicts when going  on holiday as to where they can hide their drugs. Maybe he should have  done one on how to smuggle a drink one has just purchased at the Royal  Albert Hall bar in the interval after queuing throughout all of said  interval and finally getting a drink minutes before the announcement  that the second half is about to start only to find that one is then not  allowed to take said drink back to ones seat in the rather splendid  looking Albert Hall. Ok, I'll admit I didn't spend all of the interval  queuing, rather my mate Andy did and I went out to see how he was  getting on towards the end of the interval.</p>
<p>Faced with the option  of downing our drinks in one, which I did consider, or somehow hiding  said drinks upon our person and not wanting to see how far the drinks  would go up our arses as recommended by Russell in his drugs skit I soon  discovered that my flared jeans made the perfect hiding place and my  socks the perfect reciprocal to tuck both cans into. I can envision a  whole new beautiful trend about to begin with hippies everywhere  smuggling all sorts of bizarre items beneath their oversized trouser  bottoms.</p>
<p>and for me... well, no more embarrassing moments next  time I'm at the pub and need to carry a round of 5 drinks back from the  bar. ;)</p>
