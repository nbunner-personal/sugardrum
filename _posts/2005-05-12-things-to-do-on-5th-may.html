<p>For our gig on May 5th that got cancelled I'd designed a silly flyer  about things to do on May 5th. As the chances of ever getting to use the  flyer again are now rather remote unless by fluke chance we can get to  play the same venue again on the same day next year I thought I'd post  the content of the flyer, which originally was on a nice and scruffy  hand written note, phtocopied several times.</p>

<p>"things to do on May  5th"<br />
1. do washing<br />
2. vote in general ellection<br />
3. learn to  spell election<br />
4. put washing out<br />
5. goto sugardrum gig at The  Electroacoustic Club Bear on the Square, 2 St.Johns Square, off  Clerkenwell Road, London EC1M 4DE<br />
6. watch results of general  election on telly when home from gig.<br />
7. learn to love the process of  elimination<br />
8. get washing in</p>
<p>If anyone would like a copy of  the flyer I still have several 100 or so lying around, waiting to be  turned to compost ;)<br />
