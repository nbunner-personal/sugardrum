<p>Merry Christmas! I set myself a challenge on Christmas eve to write and record an xmas themed song. I managed it, but by the time I'd edited the video and waited for it to upload to Youtube I only had time to email it to a few friends before heading back home for xmas so here is a slightly late Sugardrum Merry Crimbo video :)</p>

<p>The story is inspired by "The Price", a short story by Neil Gaiman from his book "Smoke and Mirrors". Instead of a cat being the Guardian Angel it's the fairy on top of the tree.</p>
<p>Recording of the new album is going well. I'll post up some photos from the recording sessions soon.</p>
