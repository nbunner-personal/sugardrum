<p>Here's another little video I've recorded of me playing a song whilst sitting on a giant sofa. This time it's There is a Light That Never Goes Out by The Smiths. I've been playing this cover live for quite a while and thought it was about time I recorded a version for Youtube. The sofa featured is very comfy so I can see myself recording many more song videos on it...</p>
