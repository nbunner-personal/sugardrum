<p>t's funny how we sometimes find ourselves unable for whatever reason of  telling someone that what they are doing is affecting us in some way,  for better or worse.</p>
<p>There's a man in my street who delivers  newspapers every morning in his estate car, driving from house to house,  leaving the engine running as he gets out and carries a single  newspaper to a house, before getting back in the car and driving a few  yards to the next house. I want to say something, ask him has he  considered the craziness of what he's doing. But something always stops  me.. usually because I'm late for work... but I also wonder that maybe  there's some logical reason, apart from sheer laziness and disregard for  the environment, for what he's doing. Some logic behind this madness...  and by the time I've finished wondering this I've already walked past  him and beyond the point of being able to say something without missing  my train.</p>

<p>Talking of trains, every day on my commute to work I  usually find myself being bombarded by various walls of sounds emitting  through the headphones that are simultaneously ensuring their wearers  will have severely impaired hearing in 20 years or so.</p>
<p>I usually  don't let other people's music on trains bother me. Providing it is  decent enough music I just save some battery power on my own ipod while I  listen to theirs. When the music is bad however or it's noticeably  affecting others around me for the worse then I feel the need to do  something about it.</p>
<p>There was a man the on the train the other  day standing next to me struggling to read his book above the noisy  distractions going on around him. One very well built man had his ipod  on rather too loud. The book reading man kept glancing over at him, then  back to his book, at the man, back to the book... After a while I think  the music man finally realised that his ipod was too loud and turned it  down. All was well for a while, until the bloke standing behind the  book man put his walkman on, possibly acting out of a comradely effort  for Music Man One. Music Man Two's music was far worse and even louder  and annoying. The book man started to shake his head, sighed lots (which  of course Music Man Two couldn't hear) and then, whilst still holding  his book in his right hand he attempted to mould his left arm into a  makeshift ear plug. I would have gladly given him some of the ear wax  currently blocking my right ear if I could, but after about 30 secs of  listening to Music Man Two's shitty music I simple lent over, and  politely asked him to turn it down... which he did and pretty soon peace  and order was restored. The book man by then had got himself so wound  up by the whole thing that I'm not sure if the relative silence that  followed allowed him to enjoy his book any more. I hope it did, or  perhaps he won't feel so bad about saying something himself next time...  or he'll have a polite word with the newspaper man for me ;)<br />
