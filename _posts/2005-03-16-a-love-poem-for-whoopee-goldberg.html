<p>hi folks,<br />
still busy recording - motorway song, limbo and new songs  absence of friends and hut33 nearly finished. The Rhodes piano we have  borrowed/stolen from Weston Green is probably one of the most loveliest  and most inspirational instruments I have ever played on. We're hoping  to go for a mixture of old and new songs on the album - if there's any  that you particularly want to see on there then let us know.</p>
<p>here's another random piece of fiction from yours truly written for a  competition to win a friend  a giant whoopee cushion where the only  criteria was to write a love poem for Whoopee Goldberg ;)</p>

<p>I once  had a cupboard full of cheese<br />
it smelt rather bad in the summer  breeze<br />
I kept it in the garden next to the shed<br />
where a family of  field mice made a bed</p>
<p>the legend of my cheesy cupboard spread far  and wide<br />
from far far away folks would rise<br />
and greet me in the  midday sun<br />
saying "what a splendid cupboard of cheese<br />
may I taste  some?"</p>
<p>I soon became famous, a household name<br />
but then I met Whoopie Goldberg and things were never quite the same<br />
she hated my  cheesy cupboard, the smell made her ill<br />
so out of true love, I rolled  it away down a hill</p>
<p>but it gathered momentum, crushing all  beneath<br />
small furry creatures with shiny teeth<br />
ran for their lives  as the cheese came rushing down<br />
if only the cheese hadn't been so  round</p>
<p>finally it reached a stream and fell crashing in<br />
floating  on the waves towards the sea<br />
and to this day I still think of it  fondly<br />
and I sometimes cry "if only, if only<br />
I hadn't met Whoopie  what would I be now?<br />
would I be a cheesy legend living in a handsome  tower?"<br />
but sometimes in life you just have to decide<br />
between a  smelly cupboard of cheese and a beautiful bride.</p>
<p>x<br />
