<p>Happy New year everyone! A big thank you to popular online music magazine Riff Raf who recently featured Sugardrum in the Indie Spotlight section of their website. The article consists of a brief interview which reveals a little more about the recording and writing process. They also described my song Postcard as <em>"Hauntingly Beautiful"</em> which was very nice of them.</p>
