excerpt: I meant to write a blog post a couple of months ago about taking a little break from things before becoming a Dad, but I've been too busy to write anything until now. Moving house also added to the extra busyness. I have just found a brief moment of time at 1:54am so here goes.

<p>I meant to write a blog post a couple of months ago about taking a little break from things before becoming a Dad, but I've been too busy to write anything until now. Moving house also added to the extra busyness. I have just found a brief moment of time at 1:54am so here goes...</p>

<p>I'm about to become a Dad... no hang on...</p>

<p>I became a Dad to a beautiful baby girl just over 2 months ago. Life has been both wonderful and frantically busy ever since. As a result I'm going to be doing less gigs this summer. I've not contacted my usual contacts about performing at Glastonbury or Edinburgh festivals this year, but I am still playing at <a href="//www.tribalearth.co.uk" title="Tribal Earth Fesitval">Tribal Earth festival</a> down in Sussex. It's a lovely small festy on the weekend of the 20th August that raises funds for a children's charity in Kathmandu.</p>

<p>I'm playing at 5:50pm on the Saturday and might even bring the little one along on backing vocals :)</p>

<p>Oh, and I found a nice review of my 3 Penny Postcard EP the other day in a print magazine called Apollo Has Landed&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sugardrum is the kind of one man band that the record industy keeps trying to make in a lab. His low key, mellow acoustic offerings are touching, poignant in their sparing use of lyrics and moving when singer Nigel Bunner does give voice to his uncomplicated, sentimental lyrics.</p>

<p>Whilst there are elements of folk to his mainly acoustic music, itâ€™s hard to pin it down to a genre, not that you would want to. Electronica sits comfortably next to cello and the whole thing washes out of the speakers as a single, inseperable sound.</p>

<p>His latest EP 3 Penny Postcards is almost impossible to list to without wishing it was at least twice the length it is. His reserved style calls to mind Nick Drake and his deft handling of subjects rarely covered in pop music (dementia, anyone?) should be a challenge to all other singer songwriters to raise their game.&#8221; &#8211; Appolo Has Landed print magazine</p></blockquote>
