<p>Thank you to all the people who stopped to listen to me at the many guerilla gigs I did around this years End of the Road festival and for all the wonderful feedback I received from people afterwards.</p>
<p>I think my two favourite gigs were on the top deck of the doubledecker bus that served tea and cake and the last gig I did in the woods on Sunday night, to a small crowd of appreciative listeners.</p>
