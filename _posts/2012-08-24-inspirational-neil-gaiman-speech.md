<p>Thought I'd share a nicely inspirational speech by the British author Neil Gaiman. I love how honest and simple his advice is. </p>

<blockquote><p>Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make good art.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I would do my best in future not to write books just for the money. If you didn’t get the money, then you didn’t have anything. If I did work I was proud of, and I didn’t get the money, at least I’d have the work.</p></blockquote>
