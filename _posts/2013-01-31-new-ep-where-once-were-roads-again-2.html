<p>On Feb 1st I'm re-releasing my EP, <a title="Where Once Were Roads by Sugardrum on Bandcamp" href="http://sugardrum.bandcamp.com/album/where-once-were-roads" target="_blank">Where Once Were Roads</a>. I released the CD version last May, after finishing the mixing of the recordings myself then paying to have the tracks professionally mastered and the CDs printed.</p>

<p>Then, my parents had a car accident and their subsequent illnesses as a result of this has kept me busy for the past few months.</p>
<p>I released the EP anyway as there were people at the time keen to buy the finished product, but I was left with no time to put into promoting it outside of the my current fanbase.</p>
<p>So, I'm giving it another go. My parents condition is more stable and I now have the time available that I feel the EP deserves to put into promoting it.</p>
<p>If you are interested, pop over to the <a title="Sugardrum on Bandcamp" href="http://sugardrum.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Sugardrum Bandcamp</a> page when can listen to the four tracks, download the whole EP at a price of your choosing or purchase the CD itself.</p>
