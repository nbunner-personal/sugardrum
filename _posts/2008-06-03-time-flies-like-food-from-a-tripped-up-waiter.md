<p>Oops! just realised I haven’t updated my blog in 7 and a half months!  You turn your back to do some washing up and make a sandwich and next  you know over half a year has passed, there’s a new mayor and winter is  just a distant snowy memory.</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday that I  was babbling on about the Amnesty Festival, cheese, house gigs and the  future of the bic biro in modern society.</p>
<p>During that time many  things have happened in the world of sugardrum - new band members, new  songs, a new band that I’ve joined, new homes, new jobs etc...</p>

<p>but  you don’t want to know about any of that do you?</p>
<p>You’d much  rather see a list of silly band names that came up during the selection  of said band that I’ve joined wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>Good, well here’s  some of the more sillier ones that never even made it close to the  selection table.</p>
<p>- Move like a Mercedes<br />
- Staring at Raymond<br />
-  Asparagus Monkey<br />
- Painting the Hoff<br />
- 40ft Biro<br />
- Seven rolls  of film<br />
- Gay Tourettes<br />
- Coming at you like Rayban vision</p>
<p>Mmmm,  glad we settled on <a href="//www.myspace.com/littleraymusic">Little  Ray</a> :)</p>
<p>sugardrum are going to be hopefully doing some new  recordings soon. The current lineup for gigs is myself, nigel on vocals  and guitar, the beautiful Danielle on backing vocals and the amazing  Matt on violin and electric guitar.</p>
