<p>For those going to Glastonbury Festival next week, here the times and places I'll be performing, all in the Green Futures Field area...</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday 6pm Tadpole Stage</li>
<li>Friday 3pm Mandala Stage</li>
<li>Sunday 6pm Mandala Stage</li>
</ul>
<p>Although, these may change to the nature of things at a festival.</p>
<p>I'll also have a free CD to give away with a song from each sugardrum EP, shown below being given the once over by our quality control officer :)</p>
