<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I've been recording a cover of a christmas song around this time of year for the past few years. It's usually worked out and recorded on the same day due to the time sucking vortex that is the hecticness of christmas.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Last christmas was far to crazy to do anything. The year before I managed to find time to write an original song, recorded live on video — </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://youtu.be/2WKh1ZiReUw">An Angel on the Tree</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> about a special chistmas tree angel who protects the family over christmas.</span></p>

<p>This year I've recorded a new cover of a classic christmas song, Winter Wonderland, which you can find in a set on Soundcloud along with my other christmas cover versions. The whole collection of songs it's yours to listen to and download for free as my little thank you for the support you've all given me over the past year.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
