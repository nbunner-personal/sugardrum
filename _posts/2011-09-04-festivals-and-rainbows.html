<p>Ah, what a lovely couple of festivals <a title="Tribal Earth 2011" href="http://www.tribalearth.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tribal Earth</a> and <a title="Small World Solar Stage" href="http://www.smallworldsolarstage.org/" target="_blank">Small World</a> were. Big thank you to those who came to hear me play and to Storme for his excellent percussion skills at Tribal Earth.</p>

<p>Not as many photos taken by me as usual,  just a few random slightly blurry night shots. I do like the way rainbows appear quietly in the background, offering us a brief escape from the chaos that sometimes surrounds us. Once I saw one from the window of a train but no one else seemed to notice it as it followed us on our journey.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough rambling on about rainbows, that's it for festivals for me for this year. Just a gig at the Gallery Cafe on Sat 24th Sep which you should all come to as it will be amazing as the other acts sound great, then I'm going to focus on trying to get an album recorded, yay!</p>
