It's time for a new Christmas cover, yay! For the past few years I've been recording a cover of a classic Christmas song in my own style and giving it away to family and friends as a thank you for their support over the past year. This year's track is an acoustic version of White Christmas.

You can listen to the track along with all the Christmas covers that I've made so far onto a free download EP that I've just set up on Bandcamp. All the tracks have been remastered except for the last one, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas as I recorded that one so long ago I no longer have access to the original recording.

Here's the link to the EP:

There's also a video for White Christmas which should be available soon.
