<p>Thank you to all those who came to see me and Matt play at Glastonbury last weekend. I had a great time and ended up doing around 7 gigs altogether, a couple on my own but mostly with the amazing Matt Kelly.</p>
<p>Thank you also to the equally Â amazing Matt Tweed who did some great bazouki playing with me at my 4.30am gig on Wednesday night/Thursday morning and did sterling work getting the cafe to keep us fuelled with Brandy Hot Chocolates :)</p>

<p>All the free promo CDs went within the first 2 days... must take more next time.</p>
<p>The BBC decided to film me whilst sitting in the permaculture garden in the Greenfields eating my breakfast which was a bit strange. I'm not sure they'll use the footage as I had a rather puzzled look on my face at the time whilst questioning the vegetarian status of the sausage from said breakfast :)</p>
<p>For those wondering, it was vegetarian.</p>
