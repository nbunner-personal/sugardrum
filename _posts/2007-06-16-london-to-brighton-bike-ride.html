<p>I'm taking part in the Londodn to Brighton Bike ride tomorrow. If you  feel the urge to sponsor me, however small that urge might be then don't  fight that urge as it's probably a nice friendly urge but instead, go  along with it, following it's happy glow to the following website where  your urge and you can site down together and donate some money. You and  your urge can them site down and relax with a nice cup of tea and a jam  scone.</p>

<p>It's all in aid of the British Heart Foundation.</p>
