<p>just uploaded a song onto our myspace page, recorded at our recent house  gig.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/sugardrum">www.myspace.com/sugardrum</a></p>
<p>please  feel free to listen, download and hopefully enjoy its unplugged and acoustic raw loveliness...</p>

<p>more recordings, both live and studio  on their way soon</p>
<p>huge thank you to all the artists and audience  who helped make the house gig one my favourite gigs this year!</p>
<p>x</p>
