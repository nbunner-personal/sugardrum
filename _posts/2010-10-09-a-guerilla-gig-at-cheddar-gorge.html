<p>So, whilst driving through Cheddar Gorge I decided to do a guerilla gig. A quick park of the car, and a short climb later saw me sitting towards the top of a grass bank, that looked much less steeper from the ground :)</p>

<p>I performed one song there to a group of ramblers far down below, then moved to a slightly less steep incline to do a few more songs. Twas lovely to be playing outside in the open air again.</p>
