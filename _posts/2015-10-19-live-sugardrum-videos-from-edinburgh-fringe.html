<p>I've finally found some time to go through some of the videos recorded from my gigs over the summer. I did a few gigs as part of the Edinburgh Fringe festival through the lovely people at Lost Horizons Folk Club.</p> 

<p>Of all the different venues I played at my favourite was the downstairs cellar bar at The Royal Oak. It was an intimate unplugged venue, the only distraction being some kind of electronic device behind the bar that quietly beeped every 10 mins or so - you can hear the beeping in the background on at least one of the videos if you listen carefully.</p>

<p>These videos are a little lo-fi as they were recorded on a mobile but they should give you a hint of the lovely atmosphere at the gig.</p>
