<p>Whilst rummaging around in the loft I noticed an old video game system from the eighties called the Scrollatron Video Game System. It wasn't a very popular game system so not many of them sold, but I thought it would be ideal to use for the video for my song, Bubbleclouds.</p>

<p>I brought the game system downstairs, dusted it off, plugged in the controller and found an old games cartridge called Bubbletronic 2000. The idea of the game is to fly your balloon across five exciting and varied landscapes.</p>
<p>After a few practise goes getting to grips with the controls you can see the end result below...</p>
