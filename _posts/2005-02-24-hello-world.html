<p>hi folks,<br />
welcome to the new blog diary thingy and the new sugardrum  site.</p>
<p>Things probably look a bit quiet in the world of sugardrum  at the mo', especially on the gig front. We are frantically busy  recording tracks for our debut album which doesn't leave much time for  much else.</p>

<p>We've re-recorded all the rough demos from our  previous eps and recorded some new songs with more still to do. I'm just  mixing poppies which now has some rather lush cello on it thanks to  Beth from semble.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a 50 word story that used  to be hidden somewhere on a previous incarnation of our website:</p>
<p>"So  this is my fate," thought the coffee bean as it watched the thirsty  lady through the dim glass of the coffee grinder.<br />
"Ground to powder,  drowned to drink. I'll keep her awake ALL night!"<br />
The lady sucked her  false teeth with old age desire and switched on the machine.</p>
<p>x<br />
