<p>A couple of people have asked for a copy of this recently so I thought I'd make a it a bit more prominent and easy for people to download than it's current location which is hidden away as a hidden track at the end of one of my older EPs.</p>
<p>Hope you like it!</p>

<p>You can still download it for free as a hidden track on <a title="An absence of friends by Sugardrum" href="http://sugardrum.bandcamp.com/album/an-absence-of-friends" target="_blank">previously mentioned EP</a>.</p>
