<p>I've just uploaded some photos onto the <a title="Photos of Sugardrum" href="/photos/">photos page</a> featuring some of the recordings sessions that have been going on for the new album, Postcards. So far, we've recorded Acoustic Guitars, Vocals, Cello, Percussion, Rhodes Piano, Synths, more vocals and a purring cat. Got a couple more sessions to go plus lots of mixing to do but all is going well so far and sounding great.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on the music player on this site as I may well add one or two recordings from the album once they are mixed as a sneak preview of what it's sounding like so far.</p>
