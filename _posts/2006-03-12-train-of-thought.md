<p>so, Boy meets a nice Girl on the train. Boy and Girl have a nice chat  about music, festivals, people getting married too young, blue's gigs  etc. Girl is into photography and would like to get involved with doing  album covers. Boy suggests Girl get's involved with the whole <a href="//www.wupadupa.com/">wupadupa</a> thing as it would be nice to  have some non-music artists involved with that. Boy sort of arranges to  meet up with Girl sometime.</p>

<p>Boy get's off train all happy and  glowing. Then realises that he completely forgot to get any contact  details from Girl and only gave her a couple of web addresses to check  out, this being one of them.</p>
<p>Boy feels a bit of a plonker.</p>
<p>Boy  leaves a message on his band blog in the hope that Girl will contact  him at <a href="mailto:nigel@sugardrum.co.uk">nigel@sugardrum.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Boy  worries that he'll never hear from nice Girl again and will have to end  up writing annoying James Blunt style songs about seeing girls on  trains and warbling away about how beautiful they are. Boy shudders at  the thought of having to write annoying James Blunt type songs.</p>
<p>Boy  starts to wonder if he is going to have lots of James Blunt fans  visiting his site after doing searches for James Blunt on Google as he  has now mentioned James Blunt four, no five times. Boy wants to assure  said fans they've come to the wrong place and should move onto the next  site on their list as although Boy doesn't have anything against him  personally he doesn't really like his music and to be honest finds it a  bit annoying especially that whiny voice and the tunes, lyrics etc</p>
<p>Boy  hopes that Girl isn't a James Blunt fan ;)</p>
<p>Boy also leaves a  message on said blog saying that he doesn't want any random people  contacting him pretending to be Girl as their messages will just go  straight to Spam Heaven which is a smelly place full of half eaten tins  of Spam and giant rabbits that nibble away at your toes and dribble on  your favourite jumper.</p>
