<p>I've just uploaded a new video for my song Poppies that I made earlier in the week. The song features on my current album, <a href="/listen/">Postcards</a> and confused one reviewer who thought it was just about being lonely. I always thought the words spoke for themselves, especially with the title Poppies, but to avoid confusion the song is about peace and the lonelines that accompanies the aftermath of hostile conflict.</p> 

<p>In my mind I pictured the protagonists walking through a war torn and deserted land, passing abandoned and half destroyed houses. I went through many different ideas for the video but decided to avoid using any war footage and instead went for something that complimented the gentle mood of the music, using lots of different aerial footage with the lyrics over the top.</p>
