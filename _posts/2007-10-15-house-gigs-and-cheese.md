<p>So, the <a href="http://www.amnestyfreedomfestival.org/">Amnesty Festival</a> is over for another year, over £3000 was raised for Amnesty  International and it was a huge success due to the combined effort of  everyone involved.</p>
<p>One of my most favourite moments was the  wupadupa house gig. This wasn’t really advertised at all as it wasn’t  raising any money for Amnesty International and there was a limit as to  how many people we could cram into our living room. Betty and I did a  set, followed by the lovely ladies from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/louiseshiels">My Electric Cardigan</a>,  then <a href="http://www.jonomccleery.com/">Jono McCleery</a> and his  mate who turned up to our house with a Double Bass which Jono jammed on  on a couple of my tunes, then finally <a href="http://www.wupadupa.com/wupadupaartists/tedhumphries.php">Ted  Humphries</a> rounded off the evening.</p>

<p>It was a fitting end to a  day of festival preparation as earlier in the day there had been  rehearsals for the sing thing and a craft workshop where various  artistic people were producing numerous posters highlighting some of the  causes that Amnesty International raises awareness of.</p>
<p>We hope  to put on some more <a href="http://www.wupadupa.com/">wupadupa</a> house gigs soon. If the idea appeals to you and you’d like to hold one  at your house then please get in touch. It’s such a great and natural  way to go about the whole gig thing, no PA, no scary promoters banging  on about how many people you have or haven’t brought to the gig they’ve  supposedly promoted for you and no money, just amazing music in an  intimate setting with about  30 or so people eagerly listening to the  whole thing. And we also got to eat a lot of smelly cheese....  fantastic!</p>
