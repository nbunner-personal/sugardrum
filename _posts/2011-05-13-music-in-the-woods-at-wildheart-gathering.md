<p>I was lucky enough to perform at <a title="Wildheart Gathering" href="http://www.wildheartgathering.com/" target="_blank">Wildheart Gathering</a> at the beginning of this month. It's a truly beautiful festival set amongst the most amazing grounds with lots of woods and fields nearby. Whilst there I took the opportunity to go for a wander with my guitar. I nervously crossed a field full of cows, keep a wide berth from them as I made my way to the woods on the other side of the field. The cows got bored of looking at me by the time I had past them and went back to eating their breakfast. In the woods, I set up my little camera and recorded a couple of videos.</p>

<p>First, <strong>Postcard</strong>...</p>

<p>Then <strong>Motorway Song</strong>. There's something really nice about recording a song outside as you get this lovely background accompaniment of birds singing, the wind blowing through the trees and the occasional plane flying overhead :) People pay alot of money to get these kind of effects in a studio! It all seemed to go so well with the natural shape of the songs too.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I looked around and noticed that the cows from the field next door had seemingly followed me and were wandering around in the little bit of the woods I was in! So, I made a hasty but dignified exit and ventured further into the woods, away from the cows to record a couple more songs.</p>
<p><strong>Under the stairs</strong>... ( I look around towards the end of this video to see if the cows have followed me! - they hadn't)</p>

<p>and finally, <strong>Hiding in the Garden</strong>, which seemed rather appropriate :) This has a great bit in the middle where a plane passes overhead during the instrumental bit, perfectly timed!</p>

<p>I think the cows did me a favour as these last two videos have so much more atmosphere provided by the surroundings on them.</p>
<p>Altogether a lovely way to spend a morning and I hope to go back there again and do some more next time.</p>
<p>There's some more live videos from various gigs and adventures on the <a title="Sugardrum videos" href="/videos/">Sugardrum video page</a>.</p>
