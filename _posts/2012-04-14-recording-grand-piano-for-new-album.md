<p>Yesterday I recorded Steve James playing on an amazing grand piano for my song Fallen Guru. It all went really well, the piano sounded lush and the part sounds great with the rest of the song.</p>

<p>I've just uploaded some photos from the session onto our photos page. Along with the piano you can also see a photo of my laptop / valve pre-amp combination that I'm using to record the whole album. The laptop is rather old and the keyboard and trackpad stopped working a couple of years ago after a many of years being carted around here and there. It's not too much of a problem as I use a separate keyboard and trackpad anyway, but it's difficult to break out of the habit of trying to use the faulty keyboard and trackpad on the laptop itself, hence why it's covered in strips of masking tape as a sort of deterrent :)</p>
