I've made a video for my latest Christmas Cover - White Christmas. It is made up of a series of photographs I took a few years ago whilst walking through Richmond Park in Surrey. It was a very snowy day and we were lucky to chance upon a herd of deer crossing the path in front of us. Twas a very lovely moment.
