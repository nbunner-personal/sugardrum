<p>I finished the mixing for my new album earlier in the week and sent the tracks off for mastering. The last day of mixing ended up being a long one as there were various tweaks that I wanted to make to the songs to get them to sound their best.</p> 

<p>Mixing is one of those things that involves changing settings on a screen whilst listening to the same songs over and over again on different combinations of speakers and headphones. When you're mixing by yourself it's a bit difficult to take photos of the process so I decided to take some fun arty photos of the room around me instead :)</p>
