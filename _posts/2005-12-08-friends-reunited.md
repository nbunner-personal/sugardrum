<p>Just finished a new song about the whole Friend's Reunited thing. I  didn't really get on with most of the people from my school days and the  last thing I'd want to do is get back in touch with them ;) Also, been  thinking alot about how people create these whole persona's for  themselves on the internet and then just live their lives behind these  fake persona's in a fake reality.</p>

<p>As we count the stops that  stop us on our way,<br />
Do you count the stops, to just wish away this  day?<br />
And as we sit here alone,<br />
saying nothing at all,<br />
well  there's nothing left to say, anymore.</p>
<p>For all we have in common  is the past,<br />
and all we had in common, could never last,<br />
and as we  sit here alone,<br />
saying nothing at all,<br />
well, there's nothing left  to say, anymore.<br />
so just go.</p>
<p>You see the problem is<br />
I  don't know who you are, any more.<br />
and the problem is I don't care who  you are,<br />
or what you've become,<br />
there's so many things we'll  never do,<br />
so many places we'll never get to go to,<br />
so don't just  sit there and let your regrets wash over you.</p>
<p>Get out of my way,  please do,<br />
now that we're older and wiser.<br />
Get out of my way,  please do,<br />
now that we're older and wiser.<br />
Get out of my way,  please do,<br />
if you've nothing to say now.</p>
<p>and just go.</p>
<p>There's  no one better than you,<br />
at being you, so just be you.<br />
There's no  one better than you,<br />
at being you, so just be you.<br />
