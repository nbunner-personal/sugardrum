<p>I helped organised another Wupadupa Eco show on 6th May and did a short set at the beginning of it. It was another night of great music with Amrit Sond playing a stunning headline set and support from myself, Storme Watson and Will Oâ€™Donoghue. Here's a couple of photos from the night. Big thanks to everyone who came along or listened at home on the radio and for Georgina and Clive for the photos.</p>
