<p>There have been some lovely reviews of the album already...</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fans of Nick Drake will love this&hellip; He has that feel and tone that Drake used major/minor chord progressions to create and he also transforms it into something all the more beautiful with delicate moving harmonies.&#8221; &#8211; Alex Gallacher, <a title="Folk Radio: Sugardrum" href="//www.folkradio.co.uk/2016/03/video-premiere-postcard-by-sugardrum/" target="_blank">Folkradio.co.uk</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gentle folk musings on impressive debut&hellip; gentle and melodic bearing more than a passing resemblance to the much missed Nick Drake&#8221; &#8211; Michael Farley, <a title="Americana-uk: Sugardrum" href="https://www.americana-uk.com/cdreviews/item/sugardrum-postcards" target="_blank">Americana-uk</a></p></blockquote>
