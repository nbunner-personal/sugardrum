I have a new album available of relaxing piano music. It's called Piano Days and is released under the name Jigsaw Goldrush which is a new side project of mine, somewhere to release music that doesn't quite fit under the Sugardrum umbrella. Here's the blurb from the Jigsaw Goldrush [website](https://www.jigsawgoldrush.com){:target="_blank"} about it...

> Piano days is a collection of ten piano pieces I recorded way back in the latter half of 2015. It was originally created as a gift to my wife as relaxation music during the birth of our first child and was subsequently used during the birth of our second.

>The pieces are for solo piano, recorded live on my parent's old upright with the odd overdub on a couple of them.

The album is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Ilo7im7htz1exj8zXy0lz){:target="_blank"}, [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/piano-days/1374844783){:target="_blank"}, [Amazon Music](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CN8V79L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B07CN8V79L&linkCode=as2&tag=nigebunn-21&linkId=53f02fda410bbf5762ba952f09ad7b75){:target="_blank"} etc and via the Jigsaw Goldrush [Bandcamp](https://jigsawgoldrush.bandcamp.com/album/piano-days){:target="_blank"} page.
