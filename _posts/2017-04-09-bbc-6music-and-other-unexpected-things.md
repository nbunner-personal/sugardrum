excerpt: Things have been a bit quiet on the music front in my life recently while I've been busy being a Dad, doing the day job and training to run the London Marathon.  I am however, finding more time to work on some of the song ideas I've been writing in the odd moment over the past few months and am excited over the prospect of new songs on the horizon.

Things have been a bit quiet on the music front in my life recently while I've been busy being a Dad, doing the day job and training to run the London Marathon.  I am however, finding time to work on some of the song ideas I've been writing in the odd moment over the past few months and am excited over the prospect of new songs on the horizon.


## BBC 6Music
Unexpected things have also been happening. Last Saturday I had a nice surprise when I heard Tom Robinson play my song [Postcard](https://youtu.be/4pM6WphmRhQ) again on his show on BBC Radio 6Music.  He introduced Sugardrum as: 

> "a gorgeous project of multi instrumentalist Nigel Bunner" 

You can listen to the show for the next week on the BBC website at:

## Festival news
My [gigs](/gigs/) page is currently looking a bit scarce as this has been the first year when I've not actively pursued any summer festival dates. This was so I could spend more time with my family and work on some new songs. It was a nice then to be asked to play at Tribal Earth festival down in Sussex towards the end of August. This is a lovely little festival that I've performed at a few times before, so I gladly accepted their invite to come and play. The festival is on the 17th-20th August and more details of the location and where I'm playing will be on the gigs page nearer the time. If any other surprise gigs come along in the meantime I'll add them on there too.
