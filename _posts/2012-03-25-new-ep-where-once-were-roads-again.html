<p>Things have been very busy the past few weeks. I've just finished re-mixing the EP, "Where Once Were Roads" that I recorded about 18 months ago and am about to send it off for mastering at a nice shiny studio in London Town somewhere.</p>

<p>When I originally recorded the EP there were a few things that I didn't like about it, but I went ahead and released it anyway as an internet download, before heading off to India for a few weeks. In hindsight I just needed to spend some more time on it but I think the process of going straight into mixing a record when you have only just finished recording it is a bit too much, at least it was for me anyway; a bit of break is required. In this case I've given myself a break of about 18months and gone back and remixed the whole thing, adding in extra instruments including my new guitar, extra vocals etc and taken advantage of my much improved recording and mixing studio facilities.</p>
<p>It's sounding so much better than the first version and will hopefully sound even better still once it's been to the shiny mastering studio. I'm planning to re-release it towards the end of April, initially as a internet download version only, but I plan to make a limited edition CD version too, once I have enough funds to do so.</p>
<p>For all of those you have bought the EP already, you'll be able to download the new version for free.</p>

<p>Now, back to recording the album...</p>
