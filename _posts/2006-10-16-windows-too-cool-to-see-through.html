<p>Just got back from Marthas gig. Pretty  <a href="http://www.marthatilston.co.uk/">amazing</a> it was too.</p>
<p>The  toilets at the Scala were a bit strange. Upon opening the door to the  corridor leading to them you are immediately blinded loads of incredibly  bright UV lighting. Felt a bit like a cross between a David Lynch movie  and a Kebab shop.</p>
<p>Got a lift back in the tour bus which was  nice, although it took us a while to realise that people weren't waving  back at us as they couldn't see us waving at them through the stylish  blacked-out windows .  ;)<br />
