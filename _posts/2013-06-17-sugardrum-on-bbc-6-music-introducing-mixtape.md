<p>I love the BBC, bless them they've only gone and played one of my tunes on their lovely network again, yay! This time it's Tom Robinson's mixtape show. In the early hours of this morning he played Dancers in a Painting - a song from last year's EP "<a title="Download Where Once were Roads by Sugardrum on Bandcamp" href="//sugardrum.bandcamp.com/album/where-once-were-roads" target="_blank">Where Once Were Roads</a>" about a painting that comes alive with moving images of all the things and people you love and care for most dancing around inside.</p>

<p>You can hear the show at the following link on the BBC website:</p>

<p>My song starts at 38:41 although you should listen to the whole show as there are lots of other great tunes on there.</p>
<p>I had a bit of a panic at the weekend when I realised I didn't have any decent photographs to give the BBC for my profile page. Luckily my housemate kindly volunteered to do a quick photoshoot before my gig on Saturday. Numerous photos were taken around the house in various poses, but my favourite was the following one taken in our garage, with a sort of Where's Wally styled theme of see how many musical instruments in the background you can spot.</p>
