<p>You can now download my most recent EP - <strong>"3 Penny Postcard"</strong> along with all my other recordings for <strong>free</strong> from the Sugardrum shop at <a href="//shop.sugardrum.com">//shop.sugardrum.com</a></p>

<p>Just click the Buy Now link and enter whatever price you would like to pay for it. If you enter zero you won't be charged a penny and will have a lovely professionally recorded and mastered collection of indie folktronica storytelling songs in your downloads folder faster than you can say "gadzooks, that is a bargain!"</p>

<p>The CD versions of both <a href="//shop.sugardrum.com/album/3-penny-postcard">3 Penny Postcard</a> and <a href="//shop.sugardrum.com/album/where-once-were-roads">Where Once Were Roads</a> are still available to buy from the shop.</p>
