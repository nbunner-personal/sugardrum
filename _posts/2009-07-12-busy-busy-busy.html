<p>we've not got many gigs planned for the foreseeable future as we've got  to dedicate some time to recording some of the many songs that have been  developing over the last few months.</p>
<p>The festival season this  year has so far been great, especially Glastonbury.</p>
<p>We'll still  be doing the odd gig here and there so keep checking this website or our  myspace for any updates.</p>
<p>xx</p>
