<p>The CDs of my new album arrived in the post this week. The album is called Postcards and has been nearly 4 years in the making. During that time various things in my life meant I had to put the album on hold for a bit. Recording and releasing an album entirely yourself takes a lot of work, epseically when you're doing all the recording, mixing and designing of the artwork yourself and I just didn't have the time to finish it to a level I felt the songs deserved.</p>

 <p>Instead, I released an EP in December 2013 called the <a href="http://shop.sugardrum.com/album/3-penny-postcard">3 Penny Postcard</a> EP which featured some of the songs destined for the album that I had finished, a <a href="http://shop.sugardrum.com/album/forgotten-remixed">Forgotten remixed</a> EP featuring 4 remixes I'd made of my song Forgotten in July 2015 and an <a href="http://shop.sugardrum.com/album/merry-christmas">EP of Christmas Covers</a>. I also carried on gigging and working on the other recordings when I had time.</p>

 <p>The meaning of some of the songs have evolved during that time resulting in a more fuller and honest album than if I had finished it 3 years ago as originally planned.</p>

 <p>The album will be available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/postcards/id1081336392">iTunes</a>, Amazon, Spotify etc and from the Sugardrum online shop from 25th March. You can buy the CD version which comes in a full colour digisleeve packaging complete with lyrics booklet via the Sugardrum shop from that date, or come to the <a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/26076173-sugardrum-at-gallery-cafe">launch gig on 12th March</a> at the Gallery Cafe where I'll have copies for sale.</p>

<p>I'm also in the middle of writing a book of short stories, each one about a song from the album which will be available as a limited edition book. More on that nearer the release date.</p>
