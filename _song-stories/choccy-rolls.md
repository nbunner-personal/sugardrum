## About Choccy Rolls
I’ve spent a fair amount of time in care homes over the last few years visiting family there so the short story for thisflowed quite naturally. It’s important to create familiarity in the lives of people with dementia with simple things such as eating their favourite Cadbury’s Mini Chocolate Roll each day with a nice cup of tea. 

The ideas about the photo album in the brain, where new memories or photos are unable to be created due to dementia, were inspired by the book Contented Dementia.
